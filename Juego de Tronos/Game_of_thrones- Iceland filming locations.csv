This canyon is where the pass to the impregnable Eyrie was filmed in season 4. Both Arya Stark and The Hound and later Sansa Stark and Littlefinger can be seen here approaching the Bloody Gate. 

Other parts of Arya and The Hound's journey were also filmed on the paths of Thingvellir. It's also said that some of the wildling scenes were filmed in the area as well as the sword fight between Brienne and the Hound.
